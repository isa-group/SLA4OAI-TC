# Use Cases for SLA definitions

Different use case scenarios and roles to take into consideration.

## API developer 
As an API developer providing an API I would like to:

- better understand what SLOs I can reasonably target 
    - so that I can offer an SLO for my API
- better understand the performance of my downstream dependencies (e.g., back-ends) 
    - so that I can determine their effect on my SLO
- better understand the performance of policies in my proxy 
    - so that I can determine their effect on my SLO

## API Product Manager
As an API product manager I would like to:

- know the SLOs of my downstream dependencies
    - so that I can create products which meet my customers’ needs

## API Operator

As an API operator I would like to:
-  have alerts automatically set based on SLOs, to alert me of risk of missing the
objective,
    - so that I can take remedial action
- receive regular reports detailing API performance against SLO,
    - so that I can report to the business owners
- easily see both the internal and external SLO commitments for various APIs or Products
    - so that I can quickly categorize and prioritize my operational efforts

## API Consumer

As an API consumer I would like to:
- know what service level is offered
    - so that I can make an informed decision about adopting the API
- understand historical actual performance of an API
    - so that I can understand how reliable I might expect them to be
-  know that I’m getting the service level I deserve, and/or am paying for,
    - so that I can claim remedies if SLOs are not met
