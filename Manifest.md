# SLA4OAI Manifest

## Motivation
 - SLAs are present in most commercial APIs
 - To describe SLAs into OpenAPI Spec would expand the OAI benefits (tooling, interoperability,...)
 
## Goals
 - Be aligned with OpenAPI Principles
 - Describe most common elements in SLAs (plans,metrics,quotas,rates,...)
 - Be integrated with the main [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
 
## Non Goals
 - Define a particular way to enfoce SLA
 - Be comprehensive including a wide set of elements found in different industrial APIs
 
## Design principles
 - Pragmatism to spot most common elements
 - Promote tooling to take advantage of the SLA4OAI Specification
